This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  Insatsu is a companion project to the [Hanmoto](https://github.com/waellison/hanmoto) backend.  The idea behind these two projects is to have a universal backend that can be mated to a variety of frontends, of which Insatsu is likely to be the most important.

A refactor is likely coming that will see this project using my own `react-without-cra` framework, located at [dreamacydd/react-without-cra](//github.com/dreamacydd/react-without-cra).

## Known Issues

Insatsu doesn't work in Internet Explorer 11.  I don't care.

## Name

Insatsu's former name is _WillRead_.  I wanted a name that would be less of an ego monument.
_Insatsu_ (印刷) is the Japanese word for "printing."
