# WillRead: A frontend for WillPress

[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/694d22eae26b4cc180a644c34902071b)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/waellison/willread/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=waellison/willread&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  WillRead is a companion project to the [WillPress](https://github.com/waellison/willpress) backend.  The idea behind these two projects is to have a universal backend that can be mated to a variety of frontends, of which WillRead is likely to be the most important.

WillRead doesn't work in Internet Explorer 11.  I don't care; as I write this, Microsoft is set to deprecate IE 11 in 59 days, and nobody I know uses it.  If you do, move on.

More to come in this readme; this is a very young project.
